#Step 01: Create a new virtual environment. Then install all python packages listed out in the requirement.txt file 

#If you want to adjust the underlying model used to train the Face Mask Detector, then you will need to open the following file

          *Fine-tuned Google MobileNet V2 model for Mask or No Mask Prediction - (V1 224 x 224).ipynb*
          
##Step 01: Download the dataset from the link provided in the Dataset Link.md file 

##Step 02: Open the Fine-tuned Google MobileNet V2 model for Mask or No Mask Prediction - (V1 224 x 224).ipynb and change the working directory to the location where the downloaded dataset was saved in your local drive *Coding line 03*

##Step 03: Change the working directory to the location where you want to save the trained model *Coding line 26*
