Over 95% of the data used to train the model created under this project was derived from the "MaskedFace-Net dataset". The licenses of the MaskedFace-Net dataset: The dataset is made available under the [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode) by NVIDIA Corporation. This allows me to redistribute, and adapt it for non-commercial purposes as long as the following disclosures are made. 

The dataset was created by Adnane Cabani, Karim Hammoudi, Halim Benhabiles, and Mahmoud Melkemi and used in their papers:

Karim Hammoudi, Adnane Cabani, Halim Benhabiles, and Mahmoud Melkemi,"Validating the correct wearing of protection mask by taking a selfie: design of a mobile application "CheckYourMask" to limit the spread of COVID-19", CMES-Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences, Vol.124, No.3, pp. 1049-1059, 2020, DOI:10.32604/cmes.2020.011663

Changes made to the dataset:
No changes were made to the images within the dataset. Instead, images were cherry-picked to collate the training, validation, and testing set. 

- I selected the first 5000 and the last 5000 images from the Correctly Masked Face Dataset (CMFD)

- I selected the first 5000 and the last 6000 images from the Incorrectly Masked Face Dataset (IMFD)

In addition, the training dataset was also populated with publicly available images collected via google searches and from the dataset of Mr. Thakshila Dasun made available through a google drive link shared on his YouTube Channel. The link is as follows
